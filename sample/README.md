## Demo

This is a simple sample for how you implement slide effect with `jquery-tinyslide`.

First of all, `bower install --save jquery-tinyslide`.

Second you need to host a static web server to access `index.js`.

That's all. And now you can see the magic.

### Note

- jQuery is installed with its official CDN.

### Trouble shooting

**After running `bower install --save jquery-tinyslide`, it just doesn't work as expected.**

Please check your bower's default components folder and check the load path in `index.html` as well.
